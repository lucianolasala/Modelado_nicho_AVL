This repository contains R scripts used for the development of an ecological niche model (henceforth ENM) for free-living amoebae in southen Buenos Aires province.
The repository is meant to serve as a dynamic document for other parties interested on the ecology of these organisms and it will be updated as additional data is gathered and new methodological methods are developed. 
The code included is divided into a series of separate scripts that should be run sequentially.

A Maximum Entropy approach (https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/) method was used inside the R programing environment (https://www.r-project.org/).
